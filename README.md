# Digit-recognition
One-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks (forward propogation) to recognize hand-written digits.Trained the machine with the given data set, utilised openCV to obtain features of new image and detected the digits using the trained model.For running the code make sure you have installed openCV library package to c libraries.       
dataxt2.csv contains pixel values of known digits.
datayt.csv contains the digit the pixel values represent.
theta.csv contains the features which will be used in finding the digit corresponding to the new grayscale image.
